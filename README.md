# BMI Calculator

A simple Python-based Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that accepts user inputs such as name, height, and weight. The calculator then computes the BMI and displays the individual's weight status: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese, or Morbidly Obese.

## Features

- Accepts user input: Name, Height (in cm), and Weight (in kg)
- Calculates the BMI based on the given inputs
- Categorizes BMI into different weight statuses:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
  - Morbidly Obese
- Provides personalized feedback based on the input data

# BMI Categories
The BMI is calculated using the formula:

𝐵𝑀𝐼 = (weight * 703) / (height * height )

 
## Based on the calculated BMI, the program will categorize your weight status as follows:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI 18.5–24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25–29.9
- Obese: BMI 34.9
- Severely Obese: BMI 39.9
- Morbidly Obese: BMI ≥ 40
